# Brigham and Women's Hospital Kiosk Application
Course: CS3733
Team N
## Overview
Our team's hospital kiosk application was developed for the main purpose of helping hospital visitors and patients navigate Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
To help patients easily find where they need to go for appointments, our application has options for searching for locations using a doctor’s name. 
In addition to serving as a pathfinding application, the application allows users to request various services including internal transportation, security, sanitation, translator services, and more. 
The application also includes many features for administrators to handle these service requests, manage employees, and update the maps used for pathfinding.
## Special features
* Chatbot to provide user assistance with dynamic phrase recognition
* Statistics and analytics on most requested languages, services, and locations.
* Step-by-step textual directions
* Google map with live traffic updates for driving between hospital locations
* Search by doctor to find directions to a specific doctor's office
